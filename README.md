An app used to manage and monitor your expenses. My plan is to include nice visual representation of the aforementioned spendings analysis. 
It is currently developed in polish language (code is in English, of course), maybe I will translate it later.

#Alpha 1.05
!!!WARNING!!!
From this version, until further notice (most likely until GUI is implemented), this project requires GNUPLOT to be installed and the path to it's bin folder to be entered 
in ExpenseAnalyser GNUPLOT_PATH static field.

How to use the app?
Run it (for now, I use Intellij to do it, maybe run.bat will be added in the future for this console version), login with "admin" "admin" and proceed to add expenses, expense categories etc. Later on, you will be able to calculate your total average expenses in the given category!
